Abstract 
This study uses k-means clustering to analyze the strategic choices made by participants playing the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma in laboratory experiments. We identify five distinct strategies that resemble well-known pure strategies: always defect, suspicious tit-for-tat, grim, tit-for-tat, and always cooperate. Our analysis reveals systematic deviations of the clustered strategies from their pure strategy counterparts, and these deviations are important for capturing the experimental behavior. Additionally, we demonstrate the predictive power of our approach. Finally, we examine how the frequencies and payoffs of these clustered strategies vary based on the underlying game parameters.
